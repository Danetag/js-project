If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/Danetag/js-project.git ~/.grunt-init/jsproject
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage
